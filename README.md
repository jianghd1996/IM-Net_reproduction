# IM-Net_reproduction
This is the project for course Deep Generation Model. In this project, I try to reproduce IM-Net in pytorch and optimize the training process.



Issue :

- [ ] Current sampling is time consuming
- [ ] Current results has many noise on the surface



To do list :

- [ ] Soft boundary
- [ ] Sampling method optimization
